0:00:12.520000 --> 0:00:13.640000
Wow, what an audience.
0:00:14.420000 --> 0:00:16.980000
But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.
0:00:18.060000 --> 0:00:18.540000
I don't.
0:00:18.980000 --> 0:00:20.460000
I care what the internet thinks of my talk.
0:00:21.600000 --> 0:00:23.900000
Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared.
0:00:24.400000 --> 0:00:26.020000
And I think that's where most people get it wrong.
0:00:26.020000 --> 0:00:27.940000
They're talking to you here.
0:00:28.420000 --> 0:00:32.960000
Instead of talking to you, random person, scrolling Facebook.
0:00:34.060000 --> 0:00:34.980000
Thanks for the click.
0:00:36.060000 --> 0:00:39.500000
You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things
0:00:39.500000 --> 0:00:41.080000
called attention spans.
0:00:42.080000 --> 0:00:43.100000
Yeah, they're gone.
0:00:43.320000 --> 0:00:43.560000
They're gone.
0:00:43.640000 --> 0:00:44.100000
We killed them.
0:00:44.460000 --> 0:00:45.160000
They're dead.
0:00:46 --> 0:00:49.120000
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute
0:00:49.120000 --> 0:00:49.660000
TED talk.
0:00:50.160000 --> 0:00:52.120000
It's been years, literally years.
0:00:52.560000 --> 0:00:55.160000
So if you're giving a TED talk, keep it quick.
0:00:55.760000 --> 0:00:56.940000
I'm doing mine in under a minute.
0:00:57.400000 --> 0:00:59.120000
I'm at 44 seconds right now.
0:00:59.180000 --> 0:01:00.860000
That means we've got time for one final joke.
0:01:01.260000 --> 0:01:03.840000
Why are balloons so expensive?
0:01:05.740000 --> 0:01:06.300000
Inflation.
